# Big Houses üè†  

## Inspiration  
Every Michigan student knows the chaos of housing season. The second semester hits, and suddenly everyone is scrambling‚Äîscrolling through endless Facebook posts, piecing together info from Snapchat stories, or relying on word-of-mouth leads. It‚Äôs stressful, time-consuming, and sometimes feels like pure luck if you find a place.  

Our app, **Big Houses**, takes its name from the iconic Michigan Stadium, affectionately called *‚ÄúThe Big House.‚Äù* Just like the stadium inspires school spirit, our platform brings Michigan students together to find housing smarter, faster, and with a touch of Wolverine pride.  

## What It Does  
We set out to solve a simple but frustrating problem: finding housing as a Michigan student shouldn‚Äôt be stressful. That‚Äôs why we built a centralized platform designed specifically for U-M students‚Äîwhere searching for housing is faster, smarter, and more seamless.  

Whether it‚Äôs for the school year, internships, or research, students can explore options filtered by their preferences in an easy-to-read, standardized format. With U-M email required for access, the platform stays safe and secure, ensuring trust within the community.  

## How We Built It  
- **Backend:** Python/Flask  
- **Database:** SQLite  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Jinja templates  

Features include:  
- Account system (signup, login, logout)  
- Editable student profiles with preferences & contact info  
- Housing listings that students can add or explore  
- Filtered search based on user preferences  
- Image uploads for both profiles and listings for a more real-world feel  

## Challenges We Ran Into  
- **Hosting:** Flask app could only run on one device at a time ‚Üí tricky collaboration  
- **Collaboration:** VS Code Live Share with 4 people caused frequent sync issues  
- **Frontend:** Styling and layout required more iteration than expected  
- **Hackathon pace:** First-time hackathon for many of us ‚Üí balancing learning + speed  
- **Technical:** Implementing cookies/sessions for login and debugging SQL queries for filtering listings  

Our main SQL query (for matching users to housing posts) involved many conditions, and making it both correct *and* efficient took multiple rounds of debugging and optimization.  

## Accomplishments We‚Äôre Proud Of  
- Building a functional, usable platform under tight time constraints  
- Learning new tools like authentication and session management  
- Improving at dividing tasks and communicating effectively as a team  
- Creating a product that felt polished enough to demo in just a weekend  

For many of us, this was our **first hackathon**, and it inspired us to join more in the future.  

## What We Learned  
This project pushed us to grow in a lot of ways:  
- Hands-on experience building a full-stack web app with Flask + SQLite  
- Designing intuitive forms and layouts to keep the site stress-free for users  
- Handling images & file uploads with security and reliability in mind  
- The importance of planning data structures early to avoid roadblocks  

And maybe most exciting: for many of us, it was our **first time building with AI**. We used **Google‚Äôs generative AI tools** to speed up development, brainstorm solutions, and enhance the user experience.  

Beyond the tech, we also learned how to **divide tasks, coordinate effectively, and move fast** under the time pressure of a hackathon.  

## What‚Äôs Next for *Big Houses*  
We‚Äôre excited to keep building on this foundation with features like:  
- Notifications & alerts when new listings match user preferences  
- Highlighting new or popular listings with promotions  
- Social features to help students find roommates or shared housing matches  

Our goal is to keep optimizing the platform to **save time, reduce stress, and make housing as seamless as possible for Michigan students.**
